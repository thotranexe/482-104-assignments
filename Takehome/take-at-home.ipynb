    "I used the sklearn library to fit a SDG model. Despite using the model it could not produce an accuracy greater than 65% from what ive seen. This could be due to the lack of Positive samples, despite even oversampling and undersampling. The data provided simply could not be used provide a suffecient model. \n",

    "2. Increasing alpha increases accuracy volatily, Decreasing it leaves it stagnant at about 50%\n",
    "3. Without over/undersampling, the model produces a 93% accuracy but does not ever predict a positive condition(the model only guesses 0), leaving only TP's and FN's, effectively reducing f1 and precison to 0.\n",
    "My hypothesis is that almost none of the data provided correlated sufficiently with Parasite_Status as shown below. Thus making it difficult for the model to fit a proper threshold. "
